6/13/19 14:07,"IIM Ahmedabad - Indian Institute of Management (IIMA), Vastrapur",Ahemdabad Gujrat,AICTE,,Central Govt.,1961,"The decade following independence in 1947 was witness to a surge of innovative ideas to build a fledgling independent nation into a model democratic state committed to growth with equity. The establishment of the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA) was the outcome of one such innovative initiative.

Led by space scientist Dr. Vikram Sarabhai and an eminent industrialist and philanthropist Shri Kasturbhai Lalbhai, and proactively supported by the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Dr. Jivraj Mehta, a group of enlightened individuals set up IIMA in 1961. This group ably wove together a coalition of five actors - the governments at the centre and the state, local industrialists, the Ford Foundation and the Harvard Business School, to establish the foundations of the Institute.

IIMA was set up as an institution that would be managed by a Society, the IIMA Society, created under the Societies Act. The Institute was to be run by a Board of Governors, constituted by the IIMA Society; the Board would have representation from all the relevant constituencies so as to reflect the multifarious needs of a developing nation. IIMA was therefore conceived as a Board-managed institution, free from the exclusive control of any one constituency. Thus, operational freedom is an integral part of the DNA of IIMA.

IIMA has been consistently ranked as the premier management school in the country by several national agencies. IIMA programmes are also ranked highly in several international rankings. In 2008, IIMA became the first management school in the country to be awarded EQUIS (European Quality Improvement System) accreditation by the EFMD (European Foundation for Management Development).","1.Post Graduate Program in Management

Starting with IIT Kharagpur in 1951, there are 23 such Institutes of excellence all over India today, and IIT Palakkad belongs to this prestigious group. Celebrated as a major granary of Kerala, Palakkad is the gateway to the State from the North in the form of the nearly 40-kilometre break in the Western Ghats, called the Palakkad Gap. The place is known for its rich traditions, great historical events and personalities connected with it, and its sylvan surroundings, especially the Silent Valley rain forests and the famed palmyra trees.

IIT Palakkad was announced by the Government of India in 2014. We began with a headstart in the very next academic year, 2015-16, with the support of our mentor Institute (IIT Madras). The academic program was launched by admitting students to the B. Tech. course in the disciplines of Civil Engineering, Computer Science & Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. Our Institute can already boast of a vibrant student and faculty community drawn from different parts of the country; it has truly emerged as a microcosm of India. As of now, we are located at the Ahalia integrated campus close to the Palakkad – Coimbatore National Highway, about 25 kilometres from Palakkad. We are equipped with state of the art facilities to meet all the professional and personal needs of the students, faculty and staff. Within a short span of two years, we were able to start Masters and Doctoral programs in Engineering, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry.

Our permanent campus is fast coming up on a picturesque 500-acre plot at the foot of the Western Ghats, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is situated within a few kilometres from the Palakkad Railway Junction and about 60 kilometres from the Coimbatore International Airport.","1) B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering

Financial Aid

IIMV extends financial aid to students in need of financial assistance. The objective of the Financial Aid Policy at IIMV is to ensure that no student is deprived of an education at the institute for financial reasons.

All PGP students with annual household income below INR 6,00,000 are eligible to apply for financial aid. Other students with severe financial difficulties arising from sudden unforeseen circumstances are also considered.

The Financial Aid Committee undertakes a two-step process for deciding the number of awardees and quantum of aid. In the first stage, the students are given a financial status score based on four criteria – Annual Gross Household Income (including income of the student if employed before joining IIMV and outstanding loans if any, provided they were not taken for conspicuous consumption), Household Savings, Real Estate Assets, and Other Assets. Based on this score, some of the students are called for a personal interaction with a faculty panel. During these interactions, faculty panels evaluate the financial need of the student, as well as establish the genuineness of the details provided by the student in the application and assign a financial need score. Based on the weighted average of these two scores, applicants are provided 100%, 80%, 60%, 40% or 20% financial aid.

Scholarships

In addition to the Financial Aid, which is provided purely on the basis of financial need, PGP students are also encouraged to apply and avail the benefit of the following Merit-cum-Need based scholarships:

HR Activity organised by Shoppers Stop Ltd.","Mr. Anil Somani is the Chairman of Fostiima Business School. He is an Engineering graduate from IIT Bombay and a PGDBA from IIMA. He began his career in the corporate world with the Alok Udyog Group, an offshoot of the Sahu Jain Group. He had a distinguished academic career at the Scindia Public School, Gwalior and was the First son of the soil to attain the unique IIT-IIM distinction.

Mr. Somani promoted a pharmaceutical company and astutely guided it through the economic slowdown of the late nineties with a strategic alliance with drug major Ranbaxy. He was Vice-President of the MP Chambers of Commerce & Industries. He led several trade delegations to Central Ministries on critical economic issues and also held responsible positions in several social, charitable and business bodies.
Experience in the education industry-
I started in education industry 11 years ago when we set up FOSTIIMA Business School in 2007. In 2007, when we started the institute especially in the field of Management, there was a very heavy demand, there was a shortage of institutes and the number of students wanting to get into management was much larger than the institutes could really handle. Over the years, the number of institutes gone up and the students who actually want to do management have also reduced, therefore, many of the institutes have closed down. Those who are not providing quality education, not keeping, honoring their commitments, such institutes have closed down and only the quality institutes are now running and doing well.
An inspiring leadership style
I consider that the most important quality of the leader is that he should inspire and trust, and he should be trustworthy. So, if the people around you trust you, they have faith and confidence in you, then they are surely going to listen to you and follow you. This is what I practice. I am truthful and I am honest. I automatically command the and trust of the people around me. This has helped me always in my life.
Significant challenges for the Chairman of Fostiima Business School to foster MBA graduates-
The education scenario, especially higher education and management has gone for a change in the recent past. There has been a surplus capacity in the terms of a of institutes which have opened and the students have also got various other options like Law, Banking and several other avenues where they can do higher education. However, as I see MBA scenario – the higher education and management scenario is on an upbeat, it is bound to increase for the simple reason that there is an up swing in the economy and there is a lot of room for MBA graduates in the corporate world. Therefore, the scenario that I see, the challenges of the past now seem to be over. Therefore, I see the couple of years to be good.
Importance of time management
Time management is very important for each one of us and not only for the chairman. It is something that has to percolate right till the lowest part of the pyramid and the best way is to practice time management yourself and if you practice time management yourself, then it will go down well within your office, within your team and also amongst students.
An updated curriculum
We constantly keep updating our curriculum. The original design of our curriculum has been drawn from the best B-schools in the world like the IIMs, Harvard, etc. We constantly keep updating it. We are in touch with industry corporate leaders. We understand from them what the industry demands and we incorporate it. For example, the generation subjects like Six Sigma, TQM, Digital Marketing, Big Data Analytics, Business Analytics, Predictive Analytics. These are all the subjects that we have incorporated.
Giving students proper skill set to excel during placements
The students who join post graduation in management, whether they verbalize it or not, they definitely look for good placements. However, placement is not our real objective. Our objective during the 2 years in which the student is with us – is to see that we give them all the skill sets which are required by a student to excel in the corporate world. If we do that, then the placements become the natural corollary and I am glad to inform you that our students are performing very well in the corporate world. They are resilient, they outperform their peers from other B-Schools. The net result is that more and more companies are coming to FOSTIIMA with jobs at higher salaries.

Goals in mind for Fostiima Business School
We have a strength of 240 students and we are filling that up almost completely every year. I don’t think that we want to have higher numbers. My target is to improve the student quality. Almost every year, we strive to and manage to raise the cut-offs for the students who join. Therefore, we want to get good quality students whom we can train, whom we can groom and who are very serious and we place them at a pedestal in the corporate world so that they do very well. They bring name and fame to the college and to the where they are working.","Ph: 011-46126000, 011-4635 1000(30 Lines),

To facilitate the learning process more effectively, we realize that it is important for you to be comfortable in clean and hygienic environment, especially when it comes to sharing everything with people whom you will be meeting for the first time.

This is probably the first time that most of you will be staying away from home and parents, and therefore no less important is the learning garnered out of this experience by sharing, coordinating and living in harmony with other students cutting across geographical, social and economic boundaries. This experience goes a long way in building confidence in one's own abilities, managing to coexist in spite of differences and emerging much stronger, both mentally and emotionally to take on the real world in the global environment.

To catalyze the knowledge dissemination and teamwork abilities, so vital for a good management career, ISBR has provided a wi-fi internet connectivity in the hostels too, so that there is seamless integration between the campus and hostels to continue 24x7 access to digital library databases and other online facilities, critical for today's knowledge led information age. Acess to television in each shared flat can provide the much needed break to catch up on current affairs and light entertainment. The hostel is well managed by a dedicated and humane management team , operating staff available round the clock, to take care of all basic needs, including any unforeseen circumstances like medical help, which is available in nearby hospitals and clinics of the highest standards and quality.

We believe in the old adage "" All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" and hence facilities for indoor and outdoor games and sports have been provided in the campus itself, and outsourced closer to the hostel location. Needless to add that this is an important part of all round development and students must take active interest in these activities.

Finally, a full stomach is what is necessary to continue remaining energetic throughout the day and this is ensured by the student committee in coordination with the hostel management, to strike the right balance between nutritious and tasty meals.

Rest assured, you are on your way to the second most desired place on earth. second only to your own home !


About the Hostel

Hostel is a place where a student looks forward to be after a hard day at the college. We have been trying to make the hostel the next best place to be in after home. The hostel management comprises of experienced persons who strive to provide the best atmosphere for the students. The warden has been trained to manage the hostel and also to handle any issues that may arise in the normal functioning. Adequate and well-trained maintenance staff take care to see that the hostel is maintained to highest of standards.


Food

As the students - who are from all over the country and have diverse tastes, the menu is planned as a mix of both North Indian and South Indian vegetarian food with variety every day. Great emphasis is laid on hygiene, quality and cleanliness of the food which is prepared in the hostel's own kitchen which is staffed by experienced and skilled cooks.

Management committee

A Hostel Management committee looks after the day-to-day functioning of the hostel. The committee includes representatives of the students apart from the committee members of the management. Students are encouraged to be actively involved in the smooth running of the hostel and help to maintain discipline and a healthy atmosphere.

In the ever-evolving world, the dynamics of design education has undergone significant changes. Three decades back when I entered the design industry as a new graduate with much confidence and dreamed quite high, I had no idea of the way world looked at design as compared to the way we were taught at NID back then.

As a young professional driven by empathy, it was a dreadful experience to have people reach you out for window dressing or beautification of a product. I had a minimal idea that someday, design would become an integral tool to business solutions.

As a young and enthusiastic professional, ready to be part of the change, you always want to see the world as a beautiful and better place. In most of my conversations outside the design community and creative industry, I have found the design to be greatly misunderstood and only perceived as means of beautification.
Till a decade back, education was imparted in a typical classroom format. But, today’s generation is not looking for such a style of education they need practical knowledge. It has become a need of the hour for the institution as well as the faculty to redesign the entire curriculum.

For teaching a subject like “Design”, it is necessary to give proper exposure to the student. The institute must assure to keep up with the technology and keep updating their syllabi to keep up with the industry standards. One of the ways to do so is to hold seminars, workshops, events and guest lectures regularly.

A trans-disciplinary approach in design learning is the only way out to have transferable skill sets required for this new shape-shifting industry and world at large. Design schools having very linear focus will have to gear up towards being “student ready” and the ones who encourage 360-degree learning will have to re-look at not just the content but also the new approach design has taken for itself.

To sustain itself, every business today needs innovation; the right design education will empower a student to be an effective innovator, believes Jyoti Manral, Dean (School of Design and Visual Arts, Apeejay Stya University).
Dr. Salwan on his experience in the fields of teaching, research and technological management
I have been in Research for more than 30 years and in teaching for about 18 years. I have worked for 32 years in Missile programme with Dr.Kalam for Agni, Prithvi, Trishul, Akash, Nag. I was the founder member of the Integrated Guided Missiles Programme. My experience of research / innovation is typical Dr.Kalam style. I always encouraged Innovation and appreciated those who excelled and delivered better.

Dr.Kalam always stated Research is a risky process. Research cannot be risk-free, so one must be careful while taking up research. During the programme of research and understanding, if an aim is unachievable, bifurcate it and aim at something else for research, the Environment must be motivating. Also, the idea of Dr.Kalam is that research is crucial and no postgraduate studies is complete without research.

As mentioned by Dr.Kalam: Industry, Academic and Research must go hand in hand, academic must trust Industry and Research. Technology transferred from somewhere must be absorbed. Academics must be able to absorb the fast-changing pace of technology.

All these ideologies of Dr.Kalam are the base of Apeejay Stya University and it is practiced. Research is introduced to the students from the 1st year itself.

My experience is that “Motivation comes from within, but there must be some external force helping in letting that happen”. There should be a proper mentoring, where the problem of students’ academic, financial or anything else is taken care of so that they can explore and learn from the project.
Goals in mind for Apeejay Stya University
Apeejay Stya University is born out of man-making & nation-building, we teach the students and help them discover their own greatness. We also teach students their responsibility towards society, nation, and self. At Apeejay, we help students realize their potential and rise to their potential.

We aim at making this university as an Excellent Research centre in mainly 2 areas: “Computer Science” (Internet of things, Data Analytics, Machine learning, etc.) & “Life Sciences”, so that people can research for finding their happiness.
Measures taken by Apeejay Stya University to promote research/ Innovation among students
Team Work - Group of 5-6 students with changing leaders.
Our intake is based on students with highly creative and out-of-the-box thinking.
We have the concept of major and minor, where major is bread earning, and minor is a hobby. We are a liberal arts university, we teach it on the basis of the liberal arts teaching.
The curriculum is research centric, attached with industry and thinking.
Financial stability and stability of peace of mind is also ensured.
Bright students with excellent academics are given 100% Scholarship.
Teachers hold the hands of the students; they equally participate in the projects given to students.
ASU started as the University which promotes Research and innovation and also a place for Liberal Arts, we bought together a group of dignified people to design the curriculum keeping in mind that it is a research-based university.","Apeejay Stya University,

In the ever-evolving world, the dynamics of design education has undergone significant changes. Three decades back when I entered the design industry as a new graduate with much confidence and dreamed quite high, I had no idea of the way world looked at design as compared to the way we were taught at NID back then.

As a young professional driven by empathy, it was a dreadful experience to have people reach you out for window dressing or beautification of a product. I had a minimal idea that someday, design would become an integral tool to business solutions.

As a young and enthusiastic professional, ready to be part of the change, you always want to see the world as a beautiful and better place. In most of my conversations outside the design community and creative industry, I have found the design to be greatly misunderstood and only perceived as means of beautification. 
Till a decade back, education was imparted in a typical classroom format. But, today’s generation is not looking for such a style of education they need practical knowledge. It has become a need of the hour for the institution as well as the faculty to redesign the entire curriculum.

For teaching a subject like “Design”, it is necessary to give proper exposure to the student. The institute must assure to keep up with the technology and keep updating their syllabi to keep up with the industry standards. One of the ways to do so is to hold seminars, workshops, events and guest lectures regularly.

A trans-disciplinary approach in design learning is the only way out to have transferable skill sets required for this new shape-shifting industry and world at large. Design schools having very linear focus will have to gear up towards being “student ready” and the ones who encourage 360-degree learning will have to re-look at not just the content but also the new approach design has taken for itself.

To sustain itself, every business today needs innovation; the right design education will empower a student to be an effective innovator, believes Jyoti Manral, Dean (School of Design and Visual Arts, Apeejay Stya University).
Dr. Salwan on his experience in the fields of teaching, research and technological management
I have been in Research for more than 30 years and in teaching for about 18 years. I have worked for 32 years in Missile programme with Dr.Kalam for Agni, Prithvi, Trishul, Akash, Nag. I was the founder member of the Integrated Guided Missiles Programme. My experience of research / innovation is typical Dr.Kalam style. I always encouraged Innovation and appreciated those who excelled and delivered better.

Dr.Kalam always stated Research is a risky process. Research cannot be risk-free, so one must be careful while taking up research. During the programme of research and understanding, if an aim is unachievable, bifurcate it and aim at something else for research, the Environment must be motivating. Also, the idea of Dr.Kalam is that research is crucial and no postgraduate studies is complete without research.

As mentioned by Dr.Kalam: Industry, Academic and Research must go hand in hand, academic must trust Industry and Research. Technology transferred from somewhere must be absorbed. Academics must be able to absorb the fast-changing pace of technology.

All these ideologies of Dr.Kalam are the base of Apeejay Stya University and it is practiced. Research is introduced to the students from the 1st year itself.

My experience is that “Motivation comes from within, but there must be some external force helping in letting that happen”. There should be a proper mentoring, where the problem of students’ academic, financial or anything else is taken care of so that they can explore and learn from the project.","+91-9958-977-977

FIIB

Delhi, April 27, 2019: FIIB, a B-School that keeps pace with the industry needs as well as the academic innovations, celebrated its 23rd convocation ceremony. It was a huge moment of pride for institute to congratulate the graduating batch and honor the hard work and dedication with which they have earned a business degree.

The celebration began with a welcome speech by Ms. Radhika Shrivastava, Executive Director, FIIB. After that, the students were addressed by Mr. Syed Safawi, Business Transformation Leader, Technology Investor, and Philanthropist who attended the event as a chief guest. Anuj Kaura, Product Head (Transportation), Amazon India, from Senior Alumnus batch 1998, congratulated the graduating batch and spoke encouraging words to prepare the students for the exciting corporate journey ahead of them.
“Thinking clearly and objectively is the mantra of a successful leadership,” says Mr. Prashant Verma while talking about FIIB’s initiatives to promote students’ growth
Professor Prashant Verma is currently serving FIIB, New Delhi as the Program Chair (Analytics). He is leading the Analytics programs for the institute including the flagship Post Graduate Certificate Program in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics (PGCP-BI & DA). Prior to this, he was the Area Coordinator for NIIT University’s industry-sponsored MBA (Business Analytics) offered jointly with WNS (Holdings) Limited. He has worked with NIILM Center for Management Studies as Program Director and has served NIILM University, IILM- New Delhi, Hindustan Institute of Management and Computer Studies- Agra, AIIMS Agra.

Along with teaching MBA graduates, he conducts executive training in the area of Business Intelligence, Predictive Business Modelling, Advance Predictive Modelling, R-Programming and MS Excel-based Modelling using VBA and BI using Tableau and Power BI. His training has benefited executive cohorts at Ernst & Young, Jubilant Food Works, Ciena India and leading training institutions like Bridge, which offers analytics programs jointly with Northwestern University, Chicago, NIIT University-WNS executives and Grow Talent, Gurgaon.
Professor Verma’s Philosophy of leadership is to unlock students’ potential
I believe, leadership is all about enabling things and how you are performing as an enabler. Think clearly, think objectively, and enable people around you to use something which they have not used earlier. Learn how to remove bias from decisions and that’s what I have been trying to deliver. When a student come to me I enable their unlocked potential and then they realized their capabilities and perform wonderfully. For me, leadership is all about enabling.

Including Analytics into the curriculum was a significant challenge 
When I came to FIIB, the institute gave me a mandate to integrate analytics into PGDM. This is a wonderful domain to work. Analytics is all about seeing things clearly, looking at data, taking your decisions without biases and taking them faster.
The curriculum ensures to develop students’ skills which are required by the industries
We meet industry people regularly and engage them to understand what kind of skills they are looking forward to have in new managers. When we ask this question of what kind of skills they look forward to we don’t ask this just to list the skills but also to grade the skills in terms of what is really required from day 1 onwards and in the progression of their career So, the skills which are needed in the industry are the skills that we impart to our students.

Through carefully designed courses, the students are put to practice such skills. Thus they are productive from day 1 on their job, of course there are other skills which they should be mindful and acquire with experience. Here at FIIB, they imbibe it better and learn it better. This kind of industry interaction we do regularly. This time we had a massive exercise when we were integrating Analytics. We did this exercise in a comprehensive way. There was a change required in our curriculum and now we have a great curricula. In each course you will find our students using analytics tools which we believe would drive a distinction between our institute’s and other institute’s graduates.

JKBS students give brilliant performance in the IIMBx MBA Prep Program 2018
Continuing the legacy of excellence and commitment as envisaged by its founder President Govind Hari Singhania, first year PGDM students of the school scored brilliantly in the IIMBx MBA Prep Programme. Out of the 50 students who took the exam this year, 14% of the students scored above 90% in all the three subjects and a whopping 62 % scored distinction. 98 % of the students qualified the three-course foundation programme leading to certification.

This outstanding performance in the IIMBx is the result of the collaborative efforts put in by the focused, hardworking students and the motivated faculty. Continuous video lectures, supporting notes, weekly quizzes and assignments prepared students for the rigor of the IIMBx MBA Prep Course.

JK Business School had signed an agreement with IIMBx for the MBA Prep programme in order to provide an opportunity to its students to upskill themselves through digital learning and to prepare them for the entry level in management education. JKBS was set up amidst the advent and influx of information technology and new emerging models of business. Partnership with IIMBx is the latest endeavor by JK Business School towards its commitment to provide the best educational opportunities to its students and make use of its state-of-the-art technology.
Dr. Sridhar, the convener of IIMBX program at JKBS says “It has been an enriching experience for students of JK Business School. I firmly believe that this programme laid a firm foundation for business management students who have gained from the combined power of eminent faculty from IIM Bangalore and state of the art educational technology. It is evident from the excellent performance of the students that the enthusiasm of the faculty and their approach towards learning seems to have rubbed off on the students.""

Ms.Tania, one of the PGDM students who undertook the IIMBx MBA Prep programme states, “Living in this age of cut-throat competition, being an achiever is indeed difficult but for those who have a willing heart and mind, there is no better place and time than now and here”. However, having said so the journey would have been indeed more arduous if not impossible, had it not been for the faculty at IIMBx and JKBS, who made it a point to keep their guidance continuous, simple and clear.

180 Management Students who have undergone the AICTE run PGDM Program were conferred upon with their diploma. Students have dual specialization in the program with choices between Marketing, Finance, Human Resource, and International Business. The air felt pristine to all the students who had a mixed bag of Happy and less Happy memories around the campus. Tears rolled down the cheeks of few girls who had come in with a dream package in mind and were finally walking their dreams with Flying Colors.

This is my Alma mater, my identity, said Swati flouting her cap in the air- who has the highest CGPA and in fact one of the best placements too. Sharing of visiting cards and profiles, the excitement of being in the best MNCs is a dream come true for most of them. The cherry on the faces was symbolic of the satisfaction they had derived out of the rigorous hard work put in. Burning of Midnight oil, late evening meetings, post-dinner sessions in the canteen will be missed.

Students said they could feel the same energy and positivity in the environment that they felt on Day 1 when they entered the campus. A lot of selfie sessions, group click, pictures with faculty and friends took place at favorite campus Addas! The students were thankful that the college has given them the best values, knowledge and skill set which will stay with them forever.
Group Director Ms. Poonam, said that today, Adaptability and Preparedness are the key Managerial skills inculcated in the students. They are put to tests several times so that they do not get bogged down in the VUCA environment. Effective decision-making skills which are a fine balance between management culture and organization strategy are well engrained in our students and they will always prove their mettle in the corporate world!

The campus presently accommodates almost 3000 students and 100 faculty members across various programs and disciplines.","Academics

In an earlier interview, PGDM programme head Dr.Atish Chattopadhyay said “We already had a merit-cum-means scholarship so that no student is denied education because of funding issues. This year, we instituted a very interesting merit scholarship-the idea was those who are really meritorious should get the best exposure–so the top 20 students in the batch will be provided funding for doing a full semester exchange in one of our top partnering schools in the US-they get their airline travel, visa and living expenses covered when they go for exchange,this again is something very unique to SPJIMR.”The admissions process for international applicants and Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) is still on and a list of international candidates will be released separately later.","1.

“The freedom to express and risk taking ability amongst students is high in foreign universities. We are trying to take things to that level with our collaborative initiatives,” says Dr. Poonam Sharma, Dean, International Relations, Jaipuria Institute of Management. As an adjunct faculty of Eastern Mennonite University, Virginia, she has the experience firsthand. The Branding and Retail professor reveals how her office fosters international partnerships for transformative global opportunities and programmes for the benefit of the students.

International Relations at the institute include student exchange programmes, international summer programmes or international internships, international faculty exchange programmes and international research programmes.

“The overseas experience is an investment in your future. It offers students an opportunity to get exposed to the best of international community, cultures and practices beyond their boundaries. We are also enhancing our footprints amongst international recruiters. Delegations from various countries have already visited our Noida campus.”

At Jaipuria Institute of Management we believe that all students and faculty members should have a chance to be a part of these programmes,” she says.

The institute already has 14 international relationships in countries including New Zealand, UK, China, USA, Canada and Taiwan. Talking about some of the highlights of the programmes Dr. Sharma says, “Four students from Jaipuria Institute of Management recently visited Ara Institute of Canterbury, our most active partner, for a 3 week exchange program in New Zealand. We will also work jointly on some research papers. We are also focusing on building relationships in neighboring countries like Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.”

The institute is gearing up to host an International Conference and has received participation from five foreign universities already. It is also inviting around a dozen UK universities to celebrate the institute’s first International Day.

“It will facilitate things for students and alumni who want to study abroad. We are also trying to get international recruiters in the area of banking and finance for our students specializing in the field. Delegations from various countries have already visited our Noida campus,” says Dr. Sharma.

Mr. David M Paul conducted the vigorous and immensely informative SME or Subject Matter Expert Session on legal matters for the benefit of GIBS students. Global Institute of Businesses Studies in Bannerghatta on the outskirts of garden city cum software capital Bangalore has been taking great strides in launching student careers through internships and placements. After achieving a high reputation in the international arena, GIBS plans to branch out with more institutes within India.

While it is generally understood that legal matters are crucial to businesses, the idea and application of laws are usually missed out by students eager to progress along career paths. A great majority of the students who pass out with business management degrees initially set their sights upon services with the fastest promotion prospects existing in business rather than any other sector. Don’t forget that management extends to every category of business under the sun. The combination of human resources, finance and materials or services is responsible for delivering all the wonders that surround our modern day lives, according to the specializations and dimensions.


GIBS shines at the World Education Summit and Awards 2018 :
GIBS Business School in the garden-cum-software city of Bangalore belongs to the upper crust of super-achieving institutions. Recognitions and honorable mentions have been coming rather regularly for the management, faculty, and students as they toil away day and night in search of successful business careers. The Placement Committee deserves special mention because job positions successfully secured become the final test of accomplishment for professional courses. Internships have been spectacular too.

Recognition on an international platform at the World Education Summit adds another colorful feather of achievement to the GIBS crown that has been exploring expansion options in India and perhaps abroad later. GIBS has already earned a positive global reputation, represented by alumni in challenging business roles internationally. The foreign students at GIBS in Bangalore would vouch for the institutional credibility.

The 8th World Education Summit and Awards grand event happened on 27th March 2018 at The Lalit Hotel in New Delhi. The program lasted all day long and included a conference on educational research and lunch. The awards were handed over in the afternoon. GIBS takes pride in their Chairman Ritesh Goyal being a panelist amidst an accomplished group of educational leaders at the event.
A true educationist, Mr. Ritesh shares why students enjoy one of a kind experience in GIBS Business School :
roup Chairman of GIBS Business School, Mr. Ritesh’s raise to prominence in such a short span can be attributed to his strong will-power, caliber, conviction, dedication and leadership quality. He is a true educationist who has always been in search of new and innovative methods of teaching that would create interest in the minds of the young generation.

He works round-the-clock with determination, dedication, discipline and devotion, and to him, ‘work is worship’. A strong believer in team work, he ensures the involvement of all team members in the process of decision making. He takes up all assignments with great enthusiasm and shoulders the responsibility for the outcome of all decisions. He loves to work with the young generation so as to help them emerge as confident, responsible and self-reliant citizens of India in future. He has a special fascination to be in touch with honest, patriotic, courageous, hardworking and sincere personalities, making their contribution in public life or in government departments. His mission in life is: To bring smile to the faces of others by serving them with all his ability and resources; to work with dedication and support all activities, which are designed to serve our society and nation; to work for changing the present system of governance and to make it more responsible and accountable to suit the requirement of the nation and its citizens to the best possible extent.

Mr. Ritesh Goyal has a penchant for socializing with intellectuals, scholars, academicians and professionals. He loves to read books on the life and work of national leaders, freedom fighters, great warriors, Sufi saints and social reformers. After obtaining a degree of Bachelor of Commerce from Indraprastha University, Delhi in 2006, he completed his MBA from Indus Business Academy, Bangalore in 2009. The Group has its Head Office in Bangalore, three branches at Pune, Delhi and Bangalore and has more than 120 qualified staff on its rolls. Besides, he is also the Associate partner of Adarsh Group of Institutions and Community Institute of Management Studies, Bangalore. Mr. Ritesh Goyal has Organized and participated in numerous Seminars of National and International level.

Hostel","THE DEBATE BETWEEN PGDM AND MBA :
In today’s higher education scenario, the students who wish to take up management as their division of study are often confused what course to pursue for post-graduation. The choices that they have are traditional MBA degree, PGDM or PGP Diploma Course, and PGCM Course. The students often fail to select the correct and well-fit course for themselves due to the lack of knowledge.

Master of Business Administration (MBA) is a post-graduate degree course which is offered by various universities across India and can only be offered by a B-School that has university status and recognition. This is because as per the Indian Law, only a university can offer degrees such as MBA, BBA, BBM, B.Tech, B.E. among several others.

Since, the institutions that are not affiliated cannot offer degrees, thus they work as autonomous bodies to provide the diplomas in the name of Post-Graduate Diploma in Management (PGDM) or Post Graduate Programme (PGP) Diploma. There are numerous institutions in India that offer these programmes and run independently. However, these institutions need to be AICTE (All India Council of Technical Education) approved.
WHAT THEY OFFER?

The PGDM courses are preferred to be more helpful as compared to MBA, because the curriculum of PGDM is more flexible and the respective institutes have the full authority to change and update the syllabus from time-to-time based on the changing trends and requirements in the education space. This is where MBA lacks behind, as it is under Universities and the curriculum are updated once in 3-4 years or maybe more.

Important to remember that the curriculum of MBA is more of exam-oriented and covers the technical & theoretical aspects, while the PGDM/PGP is more of industry-oriented and covers all the practical aspects such as skill development, ability to adapt as well as to stay updated with the latest advancements.

The students who would like to get comprehensive view of subjects and the programme, along with technical knowledge should go for MBA, whereas those who want to specialize in the respective field of interest and develop an in-depth subject knowledge, must select PGDM/PGP Programme. PGDM tends to prepare individuals for the market and makes them industry-ready for the senior and complex roles in Management.

IMPACT ON CAREER

So how do we find out how PGDM and MBA impacts our careers? To know this one needs to understand their relevance into two contexts – Indian and Global context. When we consider the Indian context, there is no difference in how the industry treats both the graduates. The career prospect is same for both category of graduates as the growth is mostly determined by the performance and not just the category of degree.

The packages that are offered by the organizations to the students are also not dependent on the courses pursued, but varies according to the reputation, brand image and goodwill of an institution and of course the candidate’s abilities. From the global perspective it can be further sub-divided into Job aspect and Higher-Education aspect.

From the job perspective there is no significant difference if any person is graduating from a reputed & recognized Indian B-School. But from the view of Higher Education abroad, having MBA degree helps a bit more as that of having a diploma, as the one with the former education gets marked as Masters-Degree, while the PGDM/PGP candidates gets marked as Masters-Diploma.

BULLS EYE ON PLACEMENTS

After battling through the ambiguity of which course to choose and actually pursuing those, the main aim of majority students is to get good jobs at reputed organizations along with hefty salary offerings. As mentioned earlier, companies often look out for the students who come from reputed and well-recognized institutes and are given preferences.

This is because it is perceived that a good college prepares a quality candidate appropriate for the industry exposure, as the reputation and goodwill of any institution depends on the success of its alumni base. Companies like Amazon, Reliance, Oracle, Volvo, Columbia Asia, IIFL, HDFC Bank and many others, which happen to be the dream companies for many students out there, often follow the tactics of picking quality students from reputed colleges.

FINAL WORDS

While choosing the desired course, students should make sure that they choose an institute with a good brand name for better opportunities in future. International Institute of Business Studies (IIBS) is one such institute where brand name speaks.

Also, this institution offers all the programmes that have been talked about in the article, at their campuses in Bangalore, Noida and Kolkata. Students are guided thoroughly to select the courses which are absolute fit to the students’ requirements before taking admission. The strong alumni connect also helps in the exposure of the existing students in the industry","#75, Muthugadahalli, North Jala Hobli, Near International Airport

Karamshi J Somaiya, who set up the K J Somaiya Trust in 1951. He envisaged that the Somaiya group of Institutions must be recognized as the ‘Nalanda’ of learning where students and teachers work in an integral ambience for the betterment and upliftment of our society. Later, Shri. Karmshibhai laid the foundation for Somaiya Vidyavihar in 1959 which has grown into large educational complex with 34 institutions catering to diverse fields of education in Science and Humanities, Engineering, Education, Medicine, Management, Mass Communication etc. with more than 26000 students and 1200 teaching faculty.

K J Somaiya Institute of Engineering and Information Technology (KJSIEIT), the second En­gineering College established by the Somaiya Trust in the year 2001, at Ayurvihar campus, Sion was set up primarily in response to the need for imparting quality education in the modern field of Information Technology and the allied branches of Engineering and Technology. KJSIEIT as a well-established name in the Engineering Education has been creating engineering professionals to shoulder growing responsibilities and pursue emerging opportunities with a career progression. The Institute endeavours for holistic personality of its students through array of cultural and sports events and numerous multi-skilled professional activities. The institute is self-financed and privately managed and is approved by All India Council for Technical Education, University Grants Commission,

Directorate of Technical Education, Mumbai, Maharashtra State and is affiliated to the University of Mumbai.

The Institute intends to impart quality education and holistic personality development of the students under 4 streams of Engineering i.e. Electronics & Telecommunication engineering, Electronics engineering, Computer Engineering & Information & Technology with total 300 intake capacity and around 1450 students in all. Keeping in view, the Institute’s commitment towards quality education, the three elements which make this possible are physical infrastructure, technological infrastructure, and organizational infrastructure. It has always been the major emphasis to make the Institute a vibrant place for learning.

KJSIEIT extends over sprawling 7 acres of land and is located at the heart of Mumbai city, in the spacious campus of Somaiya Ayurvihar. It is housed in an eight storied building having ground plus eight floors with airy classrooms, hi‑tech laboratories, auditorium, canteen, common rooms etc. It provides state of-the-art amenities with a special emphasis on the holistic development of students for the skilled and social development through various professional international and national bodies. To achieve dynamic progress in related domains, the Institute strives for a tremendous parallel improvement in facilities and infrastructure to keep it on par with the best institutions in the field of Engineering and Information Technology. Overall, the facilities provided foster creativity, innovativeness and capabilities for a self-directed lifelong learning in students for a constructivist learning.

We strongly believe that while academic learning happens inside a classroom, the knowledge gained outside of the class is invaluable. We lay equal emphasis on the academic and personality development of the student. We follow carefully structured learning objectives and lesson plans, and monitor the outcomes. We try to be at par with the times by adopting new methods to improve the teaching-learning. We also ensure a vibrant atmosphere with carefully selected extracurricular and co-curricular activities and give enough opportunities for students to groom themselves into competent and capable individuals who are ready to take on challenges of the real world.","1.

IITGN Help Students Fulfil Their IIT Dream Without a JEE or GATE Score

IITGN Help Students Fulfil Their IIT Dream Without a JEE or GATE Score
IIT Gandhinagar provides a short term course for students to help them live in and learn from the IIT culture. The course does not bind students to have a valid JEE or GATE score.

Studying in an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) is a dream of almost all the students who want to pursue engineering. However, only a few of them can make it each year owing to the limited seats and tough competition.

The Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar (IIT-GN) has been providing students with the non-degree programme since a decade with the purpose of hosting non-IITian students on its campus and giving them a taste of the culture of IIT. This non-degree programme is open for the students of Sociology, Engineering, Developmental Studies etc at various levels.

Through this programme, students can pursue full-time or part-time courses and spend a whole semester at the campus of IIT Gandhinagar for credit or for conducting research, undertaking projects with the faculty of IIT GN and participating in the internships offered at the institute.

The Director of IIT Gandhinagar, Sudhir K Jain, spoke on this initiative and said that its main objective is to give an opportunity to deserving students by introducing them to the systems of an IIT. It is not possible for all students to get to live the lifestyle that an IIT offers due to the cut-throat competitions in all entrance exams. Therefore, for this programme, there is no restriction for the students and those who have not qualified the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) or Graduate Aptitude Test for Engineers (GATE) can also learn the culture of an IIT.

As per Sudhir Jain, this will help in changing the complete notion of IITs being ‘exclusive’ and lead them towards ‘inclusivity and transparency’. He added that this programme is far better than online programmes in which there is no direct interaction happening between the students and faculty. Moreover, this programme lets students learn without causing any harm to their regular degree as they are given some credit by their colleges for pursuing the course at IIT Gandhinagar.

Students make the payment of an entire semester's fee and attend regular classes at IIT-GN. A certificate of completion is given to them at the end of the semester. The admissions for both Semester 1 (from August to November) and Semester 2 (from January to April) are open for all courses.


SIT Automobile Engineering Students Develop Moon Wheel

SIT Automobile Engineering Students Develop Moon Wheel
May not be straight out of the scenes of Men in Black 3, but surely a remarkable achievement for the fourth year students of SIT Automobile department as they successfully develop a MonoWheel for the college project.

Four fourth-year students of Srinivas Institute of Technology- SIT Mangalore are into the limelight of achievement by successfully developing a Monowheel. The MonoWheel is the redesigned bike in its simplest form where only one wheel is incorporated covering the whole mechanism at the least price value. The project by the students is being considered as the best project in the institute. The project has a single wheel at the outer portion where the driver sits inside the round outer frame.

The monowheel is a challenge to the future of engineering and automobile engineering. Mohit Mathew, one of the students behind the project noted that the MonoWheel is useful to reduce the space which is occupied by a two-wheeler, the technology negotiates narrow spaces.

Mathew pointed out that the invention can be used widely in agriculture and industrial purposes. In the present state, the driver himself has to balance the MonoWheel but it can be equipped by gyroscopic sensors in future to make the technology maintain balance on itself in its axis. It has cost 18,000 rupees to make the prototype of MonoWheel. The developers assume that the production cost can be cut down by 30% from the present rates if put through a mass production level.

The assistant professor of the department of Automobile at SIT, Prof. Santhosh Kumar has informed that the weight of the MonoWheel can be reduced by 10% if future research is conducted on development on its components. Prof. Santhosh has lauded the students and expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Institute for granting them such opportunities by workshops and research and letting the student use the laboratory and college machinery even after the college hours.

Dr. Sunil Pandey’s experience in the education sector has been satisfactory and amazing
I started my professional career in IT Industry after my formal education and joined academic fraternity about 2 decades back at I.T.S, Mohan Nagar, Ghaziabad. I see the academics as a noble profession which is nothing but a process of transformation of an individual into a responsible citizen with values & ethics and a competent professional who inspires others to learn, apply & contribute in the growth of the nation directly or indirectly, irrespective of profession, domain, place and position.

My personal experience in the education sector has been simply amazing. It gives a sense of satisfaction, seeing the belief and kind of trust in the eyes of students and their parents that their ward is in safer hands for learning. The hope that their career will be bright & successful, makes me more responsible and inspires to do something which can make some difference in their lives.

There is no other profession which makes you a professional, who always symbolizes a good human being, a great combination of knowledge & humbleness, always willing & open to learning & self-update, ready to share and give back his or her own exploration and learning to others to take it forward. I am of the firm belief that working in the education sector, in its true spirit in spite of all technology evolutions, developments & changes in pedagogy, the teacher in society enjoys the same kind of respect and the expectations of society remain same as it were in the past. 
The Skill Development Cell ensures to develop all the required skills in the students

IITGN Help Students Fulfil Their IIT Dream Without a JEE or GATE Score

IITGN Help Students Fulfil Their IIT Dream Without a JEE or GATE Score
IIT Gandhinagar provides a short term course for students to help them live in and learn from the IIT culture. The course does not bind students to have a valid JEE or GATE score.

Studying in an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) is a dream of almost all the students who want to pursue engineering. However, only a few of them can make it each year owing to the limited seats and tough competition.

The Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar (IIT-GN) has been providing students with the non-degree programme since a decade with the purpose of hosting non-IITian students on its campus and giving them a taste of the culture of IIT. This non-degree programme is open for the students of Sociology, Engineering, Developmental Studies etc at various levels.

Through this programme, students can pursue full-time or part-time courses and spend a whole semester at the campus of IIT Gandhinagar for credit or for conducting research, undertaking projects with the faculty of IIT GN and participating in the internships offered at the institute.

Also Read: JEE Advanced 2019: The Total Number of Seats in all IITs for the session 2019-20 is Given Here

The Director of IIT Gandhinagar, Sudhir K Jain, spoke on this initiative and said that its main objective is to give an opportunity to deserving students by introducing them to the systems of an IIT. It is not possible for all students to get to live the lifestyle that an IIT offers due to the cut-throat competitions in all entrance exams. Therefore, for this programme, there is no restriction for the students and those who have not qualified the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) or Graduate Aptitude Test for Engineers (GATE) can also learn the culture of an IIT.

As per Sudhir Jain, this will help in changing the complete notion of IITs being ‘exclusive’ and lead them towards ‘inclusivity and transparency’. He added that this programme is far better than online programmes in which there is no direct interaction happening between the students and faculty. Moreover, this programme lets students learn without causing any harm to their regular degree as they are given some credit by their colleges for pursuing the course at IIT Gandhinagar.

Students make the payment of an entire semester's fee and attend regular classes at IIT-GN. A certificate of completion is given to them at the end of the semester. The admissions for both Semester 1 (from August to November) and Semester 2 (from January to April) are open for all courses.","Contact Details of K.J. Somaiya Polytechnic, Mumbai

Top 20 MBA institutes accepting MAH CET score
Maharashtra Common Entrance Test or MAH CET, conducted by the State Entrance Test Cell, is one of the popular management exams in the state. This exam is conducted annually for admission to over 400 MBA institutes and colleges in Maharashtra. Since MAH CET is a state level exam, preference is given to candidates belonging to Maharashtra. However, MBA aspirants from the rest of India are also eligible to appear in the exam. It is in fact, a preferred choice of many candidates from rest of India because of Maharashtra’s management education hubs like Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur.

MAH CET exam is conducted in the month of March every year. This year, it will be held on March 9 and 10. Admission through MAH CET is done through a Centralised Admission Process (CAP) conducted by the exam conducting body.

The MAH CET CAP for 2019 admissions will be held two months after the declaration of MAH CET result 2019. CAP is an online counselling process, in which seats are allotted on the basis of cut offs fixed for admission. The minimum cut-off for admission varies among colleges, but the average score ranges between 50-90 percentile. We have listed top 20 MBA institutes accepting MAH CET score along with their courses and fees, to help you take a decision
